## 🚀 New Features

* **✨ Ely.by Skin System Integration**
  - Fully resolved avatar rendering bugs by routing queries directly to the `skinsystem.ely.by` profile database API.
  - Added seamless case-insensitive nickname lookup, allowing player skins (like your Enderman avatar) to render instantly on the dashboard.
  
* **🔔 Automatic Update Notifications**
  - Built an automated, non-intrusive update checker that checks your GitHub releases page (`Jeflacc/idk-launcher-landing`) on launcher startup.
  - Designed a premium, animated glassmorphic update modal displaying your latest release notes directly inside the launcher.
  - Integrated an instant, one-click upgrade button to safely launch browser-based downloads of your latest setups.

## 🔧 Optimizations & UI Polish

* **🧼 Zero-Error Developer Console**
  - Bypassed redundant calls to non-existent skins, completely eliminating annoying red `404` errors from your launcher's developer tools.
  
* **🛡️ Secure Release Notes Engine**
  - Built a secure, automated markdown-to-HTML parser with raw script escaping to keep launcher rendering safe from script injection.
  
* **🎨 Progressive Rendering Fallbacks**
  - Implemented a smart rendering chain: *Ely.by custom skin* ➔ *Premium Mojang skin* ➔ *Official high-fidelity Steve skin* to guarantee the avatar canvas never stays grey.
